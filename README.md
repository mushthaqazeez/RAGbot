# RAG Question Answering Bot in Colab

This project presents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Question Answering Bot, implemented in a Google Colab notebook. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 for response generation and Pinecone's vector database for efficient data retrieval.

## Features
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for generating responses to questions.
- **Pinecone Database**: Employs Pinecone for storing and querying vector representations of data.
- **Google Colab**: Easy to use and accessible notebook-based implementation.

## Getting Started
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Notebook**:
   - The notebook can be found at `[Notebook URL]`. Clone this repository or download the notebook.

2. **Open in Google Colab**:
   - Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload the notebook.

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   - The notebook includes cells to install necessary packages (`openai`, `pinecone-client`, `ipywidgets`).

4. **API Keys**:
   - You will need to provide your OpenAI and Pinecone API keys.
   - Replace `"openai-api-key"` and `"your-pinecone-api-key"` in the notebook with your respective API keys.

## Using the Notebook
- Run the cells in the notebook sequentially.
- The `rag_answer` function can be used to ask questions and receive answers.
- The notebook includes interactive widgets for an enhanced experience.

## Customization
- You can customize the notebook to suit different use cases or improve its functionality.

## Contributing
